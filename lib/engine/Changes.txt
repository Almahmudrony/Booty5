* Scene.areResourcesLoaded() added to scene which will return true if all scene resources have been loaded
* TheApp.areResourcesLoaded(include_scenes) added to TheApp which will return true if all scene resources have been loaded, if include_scenes is true then all scenes will also be checked

v1.3.3
---------
* Updated comments and added examples
* Modified engine so that Box2D can be safely excluded if not needed
* TheApp now supports dynamic canvas calling to fit the canvas to the browsers client area, supports scale to fit to x-y axis or resize to client area, see TheApp.canvas_scale_method. TheApp.setCanvasScalingMethod can be used to change method
* Added new functions to TheApp, Scene and Actor that can dirty all transforms and force an update
* TheApp now stores canvas size (canvas_width, canvas_height), display size (display_width, display_height), canvas scale and centre points and device pixel ratio (pixel_ratio)
* TheApPp now has touch_supported property that  is set to true if touch is supported
* TheApp now has new property called dt which represents the time passed since the last frame was updated
* ImageAtlas generation now supports start x and y position which enables an image offset to be specified
* Xoml loader now supports text_align, text_baseline and fill_stye properties
* Added Actor._scale property
* Added Actor.changeParent(actor, parent) that enables actors to be moved from one parent to another
* Added Actor.findFirstParent() which finds the first Actor based parent
* Added Actor.transformPoint() that ca be used to transform a point into the actors coordinate system
* ParticleActor.add() has a 5th parameter called orphaned, if set to true then the particle will be added to the scene and not the particle actor
